# motorcycle-helmet-detection
AI model that's powered by Yolov11, Yolov8 and faster R-CNN trained to detect motorcycle helmet from a public CCTV.

## 🏍️ About The Project 
This project leverages state-of-the-art computer vision models—YOLOv11-l, YOLOv11-n, YOLOv8-l, and Faster R-CNN—to detect motorcycle helmets from public CCTV footage in real-time. The goal is to enhance road safety by accurately identifying whether riders are wearing helmets using diverse and powerful object detection architectures.

The system is designed for scalability and supports multi-camera setups, making it suitable for integration into smart city surveillance networks or traffic monitoring systems. The models have been trained and evaluated on real-world public CCTV datasets to ensure high performance in varied lighting and environmental conditions.

## Built With
